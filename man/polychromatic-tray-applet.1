.RE
.SH NOTES
.P
.RS 4
Some desktop enviroments (such as GNOME) have deprecated support for
indicators and system tray.\& In this scenario, the user may need to install
an additional package provided by their distribution that restores the
functionality, or sacrifice this feature.\&
.P
It is observed that on some desktop environments and fast computers,
a race condition prevents the indicator/applet from displaying as expected
(including the wrong theme, or large icons).\& In this scenario, set a delay
in \fIpreferences.\&json\fR by a few seconds.\&
